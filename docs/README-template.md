## Benchmarks

${info}

For each benchmark, the left plot panel and the table show the time spent per entity,
while the right panel shows the total time.

Note that the Y axis has logarithmic scale in all plots.
So doubled bar or line height is not doubled time!

All components used in the benchmarks have two `float64` fields.
The initial capacity of the world is set to 1024 where this is supported.

### Query

`N` entities with components `Position` and `Velocity`.
10x `N` entities with components `Position`.

- Query all `[Position, Velocity]` entities, and add the velocity vector to the position vector.

![query2comp](query2comp.svg)

${query2comp}

> **Note:** Donburi, unitoftime/ecs, and Volt use a callback-based approach for their query loops.
As a result, iteration speed may degrade if the callback contains complex logic
and the Go compiler is unable to inline it.

### Query fragmented, inner

Query where the matching entities are fragmented over 32 archetypes.

`N` entities with components `Position` and `Velocity`.
Each of these `N` entities has some combination of components
`C1`, `C2`, ..., `C5`, so entities are fragmented over up to 32 archetypes.

- Query all `[Position, Velocity]` entities, and add the velocity vector to the position vector.

![query32arch](query32arch.svg)

${query32arch}

> **Note:** Donburi, unitoftime/ecs, and Volt use a callback-based approach for their query loops.
As a result, iteration speed may degrade if the callback contains complex logic
and the Go compiler is unable to inline it.

### Query fragmented, outer

Query where there are 256 non-matching archetypes.

`N` entities with components `Position` and `Velocity`.
Another `4 * N` entities with `Position` and some combination of 8 components
`C1`, ..., `C8`, so these entities are fragmented over up to 256 archetypes.

- Query all `[Position, Velocity]` entities, and add the velocity vector to the position vector.

![query256arch](query256arch.svg)

${query256arch}

> **Note:** Donburi, unitoftime/ecs, and Volt use a callback-based approach for their query loops.
As a result, iteration speed may degrade if the callback contains complex logic
and the Go compiler is unable to inline it.

### Component random access

`N` entities with component `Position`.
All entities are collected into a slice, and the slice is shuffled.

* Iterate the shuffled entities.
* For each entity, get its `Position` and sum up their `X` fields.

![random](random.svg)

${random}

### Create entities

- Create `N` entities with components `Position` and `Velocity`.

The operation is performed once before benchmarking,
to exclude memory allocation, archetype creation etc.
See the benchmark below for entity creation with allocation.

![create2comp](create2comp.svg)

${create2comp}

### Create entities, allocating

- Create `N` entities with components `Position` and `Velocity`.

Each round is performed on a fresh world.
This reflects the creation of the first entities with a certain components set in your game or application.
As soon as things stabilize, the benchmarks for entity creation without allocation (above) apply.

Low `N` values might be biased by things like archetype creation and memory allocation,
which is handled differently by different implementations.

![create2comp_alloc](create2comp_alloc.svg)

${create2comp_alloc}

### Create large entities

- Create `N` entities with 10 components `C1`, ..., `C10`.

The operation is performed once before benchmarking,
to exclude things like archetype creation and memory allocation.

![create10comp](create10comp.svg)

${create10comp}

### Add/remove component

`N` entities with component `Position`.

- Add `Velocity` to all entities.
- Remove `Velocity` from all entities.

One iteration is performed before the benchmarking starts, to exclude memory allocation.

![add_remove](add_remove.svg)

${add_remove}

### Add/remove component, large entity

`N` entities with component `Position` and 10 further components `C1`, ..., `C10`.

- Add `Velocity` to all entities.
- Remove `Velocity` from all entities.

One iteration is performed before the benchmarking starts, to exclude memory allocation.

![add_remove_large](add_remove_large.svg)

${add_remove_large}

### Delete entities

`N` entities with components `Position` and `Velocity`.

* Delete all entities

![delete2comp](delete2comp.svg)

${delete2comp}

### Delete large entities

`N` entities with 10 components `C1`, ..., `C10`.

* Delete all entities

![delete10comp](delete10comp.svg)

${delete10comp}

### Create world

- Create a new world

${new_world}

### Popularity

Given that all tested projects are on Github, we can use the star history as a proxy here.

## Running the benchmarks

Run the benchmarks using the following command:

```shell
go run . -test.benchtime=0.25s
```

> On PowerShell use this instead:  
> `go run . --% -test.benchtime=0.25s`

The `benchtime` limit is required for some of the benchmarks that have a high
setup cost which is not timed. They would take forever otherwise.
The benchmarks can take up to one hour to complete.

To run a selection of benchmarks, add their names as arguments:

```shell
go run . query2comp query1in10 query32arch
```

To create the plots, run `plot/plot.py`. The following packages are required:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

```
pip install -r ./plot/requirements.txt
python plot/plot.py
```

## Contributing

Developers of ECS frameworks are welcome to add their implementation to the benchmarks.
However, there are a few (quality) criteria that need to be fulfilled for inclusion:

- All benchmarks must be implemented, which means that the ECS must have the required features
- The ECS must be working properly and not exhibit serious flaws; it will undergo a basic review by maintainers
- The ECS must be sufficiently documented so that it can be used without reading the code
- There must be at least basic unit tests
- Unit tests must be run in the CI of the repository
- The ECS *must not* be tightly coupled to a particular game engine, particularly graphics stuff
- There must be tagged release versions; only tagged versions will be included here

Developers of included frameworks are encouraged to review the benchmarks,
and to fix (or point to) misuse or potential optimizations.
